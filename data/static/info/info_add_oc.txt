## ---=== Character Database Commands ===---
## `/add_oc`
This command adds data about a character into a **JSON file**, bound to your discord **User ID**.

Parameters:
- ocname: `Type: String.` This is the **nickname** for your character, and will also be the **index** of the character (lowercase). **The nickname can be edited later! The index, however, cannot.**
- fullname: `Type: String.` This is the **full name** for your character, so do put the entire thing in there, First Middle Last!
- species: `Type: String.` This is the **species** of the character. It'll be useful when you want to describe them later!
- pronouns: `Type: String.` This is the field for **Pronouns**. Typically, we follow the `They/Them` format.
- age: `Type: Integer.` This field is self-explanitory. It **only accepts integers** though.
- type1: `Type: String.` This field will be the **Primary Type** of the character, let it be Stellar, Bird, Fighting, whatever!
- OPTIONAL type2: `Type: String.` see: type1, **Secondary Type**.
- OPTIONAL teratype: `Type: String.` see: type1, **Terastal Type**.
- OPTIONAL nature: `Type: String.` This field will be the nature of your character. It's just cosmetic and does nothing though.
